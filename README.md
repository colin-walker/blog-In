# blog-In
The (b)log-In blogging system.

(b)log-In (a play on blogging, login and inline) is a custom CMS built specifically for blogging that emerged from my efforts to make WordPress a simpler platform.
It is a relatively simple PHP site connecting to a MySQL database.
The core idea of (b)log-In is that each day is a self-contained unit which, by default reads chronologically — top down — opposite to a traditional blog. This can be changed to suit your needs.
